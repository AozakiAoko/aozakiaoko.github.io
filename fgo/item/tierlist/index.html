            Critical-focused Servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles. 
            Has no critical damage up but has both star attraction and star-on-demand skills.
            Combination of Crest of the Stars and Defence Down on her Noble Phantasm allow for powerful Single-Target brave chains.
            Lacks survivability so it needs to be taken in consideration during long battles.
            Decent NP generation speed. Very straightforward, easy touse, all-around good servant.

            Hybrid Arts damage-dealer / Arts support. 
            Very good at boosting one unit's damage output and np generation and can deal decent damage herself.
            Lacks any significant team-wide support abilities herself so despite being hybrid support she also heavily relies on primary support of the team.
            Versatile - can be used outside of Arts teams as a hybrid support as well but with less effect.

            Heavily critical-focused servant with extremely versatile kit and insane single-target damage output.
            Emptiness A is both invincibility and debuff-clear skill.
            Heavenly Eyes A is superior Buster Buff with Invincibility Pierce.
            Noble Phantasm has natural NP damage up on cast, features extremely high single-target damage
            and breaks enemy buffs for follow-up Brave Chain.
            Fifth Sequence A allows for back-to-back Noble Phantasm critical brave chains, one-turn NP charge and boosts damage.
            Triple Buster card deck allows for easy Buster Brave Chains and damage min-maxing.

            Critical-focused Servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles. 
            Strongest Enemy-Team offensive Noble Phantasm in the gamea and good raw stats on top of Charisma-type skill.
            Excellent NP generation speed with both NP Rate buff and instant NP Charge ability as well as star-attraction.
            Best suited for multiple servants boss-fights with NP as main source of damage and 
            considerable critical brave-chain potential as the second source of damage.
            Pure NP-spam compositions also work well.

            Critical-focused Servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles. 
            Noble Phantasm features both excellent damage and a setup for Buster Brave Chain.
            Noble Phantasm is also very spammable due to 50% Instant NP charge skill and very high NP generation.
            Up to 70% attack up and team-wide critical damage bonus allow insane damage on critical brave chains
            but require careful planning in order to max the damage output.
            Best suited for multiple servants boss-fights with NP as secondary source of damage and 
            insane critical brave-chain potential as the primary source of damage.
            Very good farming unit.

            One of the best damage amplificators in the game + best isntant np charger in the game + excellent stalling and defensive.

            Berserker-class servant with more survivability than average non-Berserker-class servant along with excellent raw stats.
            Frenzy of Spirits is excellent at helping his supports survive. Noble Phantasm is excellent for brave chains. Decent NP charge speed.
            Lacks critical damage-type skills therefore requires 40-50 stars generated per turn to minmax his damage. 
            Most valuable universal single-target damage dealer in the game.

        <div class="svt_114">
            Critical-focused Berserker-class servant with Enemy-Team NP and power-up with a wide array of targets.
            Good for boss rushes with Noble Phantasm followed up with Buster Brave chain. 
            Lack of critical damage bonus is not crucial to Berserker-class servant. Star attraction skill allows for easy Critical brave chains.
            Very high damage output in both single- and multiple- boss type situations.
            Has survivability issues due to Buster-Up and Dodge being tied to the same skills.
            Primarily is for one-and-done battles otherwise requires a lot of defence and sustain.
            Good for farming but lack of NP Charge skill means that Kaleidoscope and/or outside help is required for effective farming.

            Survival-oriented support with Noble Phantasm as her main feature. Skillset is somewhat lackluster, with 2/3 skills being situationalyl usefil.
            After NP interlude she can spam her NP Arts chains for frequent team-wide invincibility, debuff clear, defence and heal. However, defence buff has a very poor scaling and heal is not particularly potent.
            Her primary role is debuff-clear + heal + invincibility spam in dedicated Arts compositions. Low attack stat doesnt allow any significant damage output outside of very specific teams.
            Cannot function as primary support for the team but as a Ruler boosts very high survivability by default. Invincibility spam is often invaluable despide requiring dedicated team.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_93">
            Buster-oriented Ruler-class servant. His primary role is to spam his Noble Phantasm which breaks buffs before doing damage - a property which makes that particular servant extremely versatile in any kid of difficult content.
            Has a good NP generation speed because of Baptism Sacrament, benefits from Buster-Critical team compositions and despite lackluster attack stat has reasonable damage output due to Divine Judgement 3-turn Buster buff.
            As a Ruler has great survivability compared to other similar servants. Reasonably powerful Buster Brave Chains.
            Fits primarily in boss rush battles. Can be used against single target enemy but not lackluster in that situation.
            Worth mentioning that he is probably the single most annoying enemy servant to face in the game.

            60% uptime star attraction + critical damage AND 60% uptime 20-40% attack buff AND 50% buster-up AND invincibility skill.
            Very fast NP generation speed due to good natural NP rate, hitcounts, critical-oriented focus on top of Avenger-class passives.
            Buff denial on her Noble Phantasm is extremely useful against all kind of targets.
            Somewhat lacks survivability due to poor HP stat and Invincibility tied up with Buster UP, so even though she is not a Berserker - caution must be exercised at times.
            Most valuable universal Critical-Burst servant in the game.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_163">
            Dedicated damage-dealer against Cavalry-class servants. Crime Ballet A compensates for demerit of Sadistic Streak A which is a very good attack buff.
            Melt Virus EX is rather situation skill. Noble Phantasm deals a lot of damage and breaks enemy buffs. Also has Quick Up property but it scales poorly and for this particular servant
            Noble Phantasm brave chains are more preferable - her NP generation speed is particularly high. Also has a good star generation abilities and benefits from Critical-focused team compositions.
            Due to Alter Ego class unique position in Class Triangle fares better in comparision to other servants with similar role than she would in a standard class.

            Very unique servant best suited for Critical Arts teams. Noble Phantasm allows whole team to bypass every defence measure enemy might have that can be bypassed at all by the player and he can spam it.
            Outstanding partial-support, partial-damage-dealer servant best suited in the Arts team with at least one other Servant who offers both damage and survivability along with pure survivability support.
            Best if you aim to deal damage with not only NPs but also with critical hits. Excellent raw stats on top of Ruler class and Dodge, NP seal and Debuff Immunity.
            Unfortunately, doesnt offer much survivability to the rest of the team. Requires other 2 members cover required defence / heal / damage requirements.
            Excellent raw stats on top of Ruler class, extreme survavability with NP seal, Dodge, and Debuff Immunity skills 
            enable him to be the sole damage-dealer on the team which opens more options but he is not the best at dishing out pure damage (hybrid team composition described earlier is advised).
