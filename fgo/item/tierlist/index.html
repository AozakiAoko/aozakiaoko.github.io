            Buster-type Servant oriented on spamming NP to deal damage for multiple enemies.
            Charisma-type skill and NP recharge allow for decent NP damage. Mana Burst and Instict best used to setup critical buster brave chain for single-target damage.
            High HP stat but no survivability skills. Average NP damage overall and NP spamming ability is not particularly high.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_8">
            Critical-focused Servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles. 
            Has no critical damage up but has both star attraction and star-on-demand skills.
            Combination of Crest of the Stars and Defence Down on her Noble Phantasm allow for powerful Single-Target brave chains.
            Lacks survivability so it needs to be taken in consideration during long battles.
            Decent NP generation speed. Very straightforward, easy touse, all-around good servant.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_68">
            Single-Target servant who is best at killing bosses. 40% Critical damage up, star attraction for one turn and 50% Quick Up allows for powerful one-time critical brave chains.
            Noble Phantasm has very strong defence down effect which along with very high NP generation and star generation allow consecutive NP Brave Chains for more single target damage.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_76">
            Farming-oriented servant - 30% instant NP charge on Helm of Hidden Infidelity and decent NP damage with Buster Up skill.
            Helm of Hidden Infidelity also provides debuff clear and significant defence boost for difficult battles but this servant is not optimal pick for that kind of content.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_90 SA_NeroBride">
            Hybrid Arts damage-dealer / Arts support. 
            Very good at boosting one unit's damage output and np generation and can deal decent damage herself.
            Lacks any significant team-wide support abilities herself so despite being hybrid support she also heavily relies on primary support of the team.
            Versatile - can be used outside of Arts teams as a hybrid support as well but with less effect.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_91 SA_Shiki">
            Arts-focused servant with NP which deals damage to enemy team. 
            NP is good because it can be used with MEoDP for and break invincibility and it ignores defence as well.
            It also cleans debuffs from the team.
            Lack of invincibility or dodge skill is partially compensated with very potent heal.
            Low attack stat and MEoDP lasting 1 turn significantly limit damage output compared to other servants filling similar role.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_153">
            Heavily critical-focused servant with extremely versatile kit and insane single-target damage output.
            Emptiness A is both invincibility and debuff-clear skill.
            Heavenly Eyes A is superior Buster Buff with Invincibility Pierce.
            Noble Phantasm has natural NP damage up on cast, features extremely high single-target damage
            and breaks enemy buffs for follow-up Brave Chain.
            Fifth Sequence A allows for back-to-back Noble Phantasm critical brave chains, one-turn NP charge and boosts damage.
            Triple Buster card deck allows for easy Buster Brave Chains and damage min-maxing.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_160">
            Buster-oriented servant with bonus damage against [Giant] enemies. 20% NP charge on Giant Beast Hunt also makes him decent farming unit.
            Bonus damage is fairly significant if there is more than one Giant enemy to kill per quest.
        </div>

        <div class="svt_12">
            Critical-focused Servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles. 
            Strongest Enemy-Team offensive Noble Phantasm in the gamea and good raw stats on top of Charisma-type skill.
            Excellent NP generation speed with both NP Rate buff and instant NP Charge ability as well as star-attraction.
            Best suited for multiple servants boss-fights with NP as main source of damage and 
            considerable critical brave-chain potential as the second source of damage.
            Pure NP-spam compositions also work well.
            Good farming unit.

            All-around good Archer with NP spam as his main strength. 
            His Noble Phantasm has a decent range of targets its effective against.
            His entire skillset is dedicated to spamming Noble Phantasm at least 2 withing 3 turns when you have your skills available:
            50% NP rate up, 50% instant np charge, 20% attack up for 3 turns and 80% chance to get 30% NP power up for 3 turns.
            Craft Essences which boost Buster cards and / or NP power are preferable.

        <div class="svt_142">
            Critical-focused Servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles. 
            Noble Phantasm features both excellent damage and a setup for Buster Brave Chain.
            Noble Phantasm is also very spammable due to 50% Instant NP charge skill and very high NP generation.
            Up to 70% attack up and team-wide critical damage bonus allow insane damage on critical brave chains
            but require careful planning in order to max the damage output.
            Best suited for multiple servants boss-fights with NP as secondary source of damage and 
            insane critical brave-chain potential as the primary source of damage.
            Very good farming unit.

        <div class="svt_70">
            Lancer-class servant designed specifically for boss battles. 
            Heavily reliant on outside supports, but has very high damage ceiling with proper setup.
            Main source of damage is Godslayer B with 100% power-up against Divine and Undead targets.
            Primal Rune is used to boost NP damage or Brave Chain damage as well as to boost allies.
            Wisdom of the Abyss is to be used depending on whether you need damage or survivability more.
            Noble Phantasm has guaranteed stun property which is invaluable against bosses, specifically against heavy hitters.
            Noble Phantasm generation is rather slow and requires critical hits for amplification.
            Therefore Critical + NP-generation heavy team is required to min-max the damage and spam NP stun.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_85 LA_Karna">
            Critical-focused servant suitable for both boss rushes and single boss battles.
            Noble Phantasm applied Buster weakness to the enemies which amplifies follow-up damage from Buster cards.
            Uncrowned Arts Mastery has 40% Critical Damage up to further amplify follow-up buster damage.
            Good base NP generation and 25% NP charge skill allow to use NP frequently.
            NP seal on Discernment of the Poor provides some stalling capability.
            Best used against Divine bosses in Buster-Critical teams.

            20% charisma-type skill, 30% defence down on Midsummer Curse, 50% Critical Damage up on Goddess Metamorphosis 
            all suit the goal of killing the boss with a single Noble Phantasm Brave Chain.
            Has good NP generation speed. Midsummer Curse demerit can be accounted for and even turned to your advantage and not really a reason to concern.

            Voyager of the Storm is useful for chaining offensive Noble Phantasms.

            Single-Target Rider-class servant with a very solid skillset and base parameters.
            Has 68% attack up from 2 skills with 50% uptime which basically puts his damage on Berserker-class level.
            Defence Up and self-heal help considerably with survivability.
            Noble Phantasm has NP seal and defence down properies which further amplifies damage against single target.
            Protection of the Sun god has unique property of boosting Success Rate which synergizes well with his own Imperial Privelege.
            Critical Buster teams are best fit for him by default due to naturally high Rider star attraction and high base NP generation speed.

        <div class="svt_144">
            Single-Target Critical-oriented Rider.
            30% targetable Buster Up and charisma-type skill make her somewhat useful and functional in the team with more than one damage-dealer,
            but her primary role is Noble Phantasm spam and Critical Brave Chains with Lucha Libre EX. 
            Her Good God's Wisdom is also more valuable as targetable guts than targetable Buster Up. 
            Noble Phantasm is used primarily for damage even though it has NP seal property.
            As a Rider she has no need for star attraction boost which works great with her Critical Damage Up from Lucha Libre EX.
            Worth mentioning that she has 50% Debuff Resistance from Magic Resistance and Goddess Core passives.

            One of the best damage amplificators in the game + best isntant np charger in the game + excellent stalling and defensive.
            Any servant in the game benefits from having Waver as a support.
            Only downside is the lack of healing. Most valuable universal support.

            Frenzy of Spirits is excellent at helping his supports survive. Noble Phantasm is excellent for brave chains. Decent NP charge speed.
            Lacks critical damage-type skills therefore requires 40-50 stars generated per turn to minmax his damage. 
            Most valuable universal single-target damage dealer in the game.

        <div class="svt_114">
            Critical-focused Berserker-class servant with Enemy-Team NP and power-up with a wide array of targets.
            Good for boss rushes with Noble Phantasm followed up with Buster Brave chain. 
            Lack of critical damage bonus is not crucial to Berserker-class servant. Star attraction skill allows for easy Critical brave chains.
            Very high damage output in both single- and multiple- boss type situations.
            Has survivability issues due to Buster-Up and Dodge being tied to the same skills.
            Primarily is for one-and-done battles otherwise requires a lot of defence and sustain.
            Good for farming but lack of NP Charge skill means that Kaleidoscope and/or outside help is required for effective farming.

            Can be run as a support for frequent but weak heal and star generation but is not advisable.
            Primary damage-dealer against bosses is her main role. Has a very high NP generation speed due to high hitcounts and frequent critical hits.

            Self-sufficient Assassin, sort of a hybrid damage dealer - support.
            Her support comes from being an assassin and generation a lot of stars as well as having stars on demand on her 3rd skill.
            Her offence comes from frequent, extremely spammable NP which grants buster up before doing damage and Imperial Privelege attack up.
            She is one of the most self-sufficient servants in the game, with Imperial Privelege with defence up and heal, invincibility skill for survivability, and very high NP generation from Golden Rule skill.
            The best and probably only Assassin worth using as a support star-generator.
        </div>
        <div class="svt_154">
            Buster-focused assassin best suited with Buster teams with considerable offensive power.
            Has excellent survivability and self-attack and buster boost. 
            Noble Phantasm doesnt have any useful secondary effects, but is a good source of damage along with 3 buster cards in the deck.

            Survival-oriented support with Noble Phantasm as her main feature. Skillset is somewhat lackluster, with 2/3 skills being situationalyl usefil.
            After NP interlude she can spam her NP Arts chains for frequent team-wide invincibility, debuff clear, defence and heal. However, defence buff has a very poor scaling and heal is not particularly potent.
            Her primary role is debuff-clear + heal + invincibility spam in dedicated Arts compositions. Low attack stat doesnt allow any significant damage output outside of very specific teams.
            Cannot function as primary support for the team but as a Ruler boosts very high survivability by default. Invincibility spam is often invaluable despide requiring dedicated team.

            Buster-oriented Ruler-class servant. His primary role is to spam his Noble Phantasm which breaks buffs before doing damage - a property which makes that particular servant extremely versatile in any kid of difficult content.
            Has a good NP generation speed because of Baptism Sacrament, benefits from Buster-Critical team compositions and despite lackluster attack stat has reasonable damage output due to Divine Judgement 3-turn Buster buff.
            As a Ruler has great survivability compared to other similar servants. Reasonably powerful Buster Brave Chains.
            Fits primarily in boss rush battles. Can be used against single target enemy but not lackluster in that situation.
            Worth mentioning that he is probably the single most annoying enemy servant to face in the game.

            Very fast NP generation speed due to good natural NP rate, hitcounts, critical-oriented focus on top of Avenger-class passives.
            Buff denial on her Noble Phantasm is extremely useful against all kind of targets.
            Somewhat lacks survivability due to poor HP stat and Invincibility tied up with Buster UP, so even though she is not a Berserker - caution must be exercised at times.
            Most valuable universal Critical-Burst servant in the game.

        <div class="svt_163">
            Dedicated damage-dealer against Cavalry-class servants. Crime Ballet A compensates for demerit of Sadistic Streak A which is a very good attack buff.
            Melt Virus EX is rather situation skill. Noble Phantasm deals a lot of damage and breaks enemy buffs. Also has Quick Up property but it scales poorly and for this particular servant
            Noble Phantasm brave chains are more preferable - her NP generation speed is particularly high. Also has a good star generation abilities and benefits from Critical-focused team compositions.
            Due to Alter Ego class unique position in Class Triangle fares better in comparision to other servants with similar role than she would in a standard class.

            Very unique servant best suited for Critical Arts teams. Noble Phantasm allows whole team to bypass every defence measure enemy might have that can be bypassed at all by the player and he can spam it.
            Outstanding partial-support, partial-damage-dealer servant best suited in the Arts team with at least one other Servant who offers both damage and survivability along with pure survivability support.
            Best if you aim to deal damage with not only NPs but also with critical hits. Excellent raw stats on top of Ruler class and Dodge, NP seal and Debuff Immunity.
            Unfortunately, doesnt offer much survivability to the rest of the team. Requires other 2 members cover required defence / heal / damage requirements.
            Excellent raw stats on top of Ruler class, extreme survavability with NP seal, Dodge, and Debuff Immunity skills 
            enable him to be the sole damage-dealer on the team which opens more options but he is not the best at dishing out pure damage (hybrid team composition described earlier is advised).
